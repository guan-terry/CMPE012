Lab 2: Introduction to Logic with Multimedia logic
1/28/18
01H, Michael Powell

Q1.
If I dind't have my own 7-segment display from MML, I probably would have used the LED 
and lined them up into a 7 segment display like the one on MML and tried to use logic 
to make it look like a number.

Q2.
From previous courses, I learned that random number generators are not actually "random" 
due to the fact that there is nothing truly "random" in a computer. From my basic 
understanding it uses time to make a "random" number that is almost random.

Q3.
Using time to make a "random" element appear. Time is a great way to make things random 
because you would never know the exact time the user would press the "start" button and 
therefore it will be somewhat random.


Lab report write up

This lab taught me how to use MML as a whole and formally intorudced me to logic and 
gates. I previously had known some logic from previous course (CMPE16) and gates from 
my dad, but nothing was particularly formal. 

What was particularly surprising for me about gates and logic is how easy it is to get 
into and how fast I was able to learn these concepts. Part B specifically was extremely 
helpful to me due to the schematic guide provided by the lab report. It definently 
help me understand more about how the LED, switches, and 7-segment display works in 
MML. Part C for me definently took the most time because I wasn't sure how I was going 
to implement the truth table without cluttering up my schematic.

Putting comments into my schematic is pretty fustrating, I know that it is good practice 
and good documentation, but frankly I find it extremely tedious and annoying.
