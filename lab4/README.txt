Lab4: DEADBEEF in Mips

I learned how to use while, basic if, and basic use of registers in Mips. I Watched a 
lot of youtube videos on how mips works, it really helpd me understand how division 
works in mips. I tried to start the program right away and that didn't work very well 
for me. I tried to make basic programs using mips, and I was struggling with Hello World 
unless I google how to do it. After watching the youtube videos from "Quasar Distant", 
he helped me understand it a lot better. I watched his MIPS tutorial 7 - 12 and 19- 23.

1. In theory, N can be as large as 32 bits because the register only goes up to 32 bits.
2. It is stored in address 0x10010000 to 0x100100c.
3. Of the instructions I 7 of them were pseudo ops. The assembled instructions 
produced the appropriate results by expanding the pseudo ops.

4. I've used v0, a0, t0, t1, t2, t3, t4, s0, s1, lo, which totals 10 registers.
